# OpenLMS

An open source library management system built with React. The aim of this project is to provide a system that libraries can use to keep track of stock and borrowers as well as the usage of their stock (items being loaned out, returned etc). The finished project should also have reporting functions implemented so that library staff can see useful statistics in order to help make purchasing decisions on new stock, help inform promotion of stock or user engagement (particularly in educational settings).

# For Developers
